### Requirements

#### Contributing to the language files

Practically no technical requirements, you can even edit online, right here on GitHub.



#### Building language packages

scriptcs (http://scriptcs.net/) is needed for the build script.


**Installing scriptcs via [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/)**

You can install the latest stable version of scriptcs from the console:

 ```

Chocolatey will install scriptcs to %APPDATA%\scriptcs\ and update your PATH accordingly.

*Note: You may need to restart your command prompt after the installation completes.*
